# Monitoring

Kublade provides comprehensive monitoring capabilities for your Kubernetes clusters, automatically collecting and aggregating metrics at multiple levels. The monitoring system is designed to provide real-time insights into cluster health, resource usage, and performance.

## Monitoring Levels[​](#monitoring-levels "Direct link to Monitoring Levels")

The system monitors resources at different levels:

### Global Level[​](#global-level "Direct link to Global Level")

* Overall system health
* Cross-cluster resource utilization
* Global alert status
* System-wide metrics aggregation
* Performance trends across all clusters

### Project Level[​](#project-level "Direct link to Project Level")

* Project-wide resource usage
* Aggregated cluster metrics
* Project-specific alerts
* Resource allocation across clusters
* Project health status

### Cluster Level[​](#cluster-level "Direct link to Cluster Level")

* Cluster health status
* Node status and metrics
* Resource utilization
* Network performance
* Storage capacity
* Pod distribution

### Node Level[​](#node-level "Direct link to Node Level")

* CPU usage and allocation
* Memory consumption
* Storage utilization
* Network I/O
* Pod count and status
* System load

## Automated Monitoring[​](#automated-monitoring "Direct link to Automated Monitoring")

Kublade automatically sets up and maintains monitoring through several components:

### Status Monitoring[​](#status-monitoring "Direct link to Status Monitoring")

* `StatusMonitoring` job runs periodically
* Tracks cluster availability
* Monitors node health
* Updates cluster status
* Reports real-time health

### Resource Monitoring[​](#resource-monitoring "Direct link to Resource Monitoring")

* `LimitMonitoring` job collects metrics
* Tracks CPU utilization
* Monitors memory usage
* Measures storage consumption
* Counts pod usage
* Calculates resource percentages

### Metrics Collection[​](#metrics-collection "Direct link to Metrics Collection")

* Collects node metrics via cAdvisor
* Aggregates cluster-level metrics
* Tracks resource quotas
* Monitors namespace usage
* Records historical data

## Status Aggregation[​](#status-aggregation "Direct link to Status Aggregation")

The system uses boolean values to track health status at different levels:

### Cluster Status[​](#cluster-status "Direct link to Cluster Status")

* `true`: Cluster is healthy and operational
* `false`: Cluster is unhealthy or unreachable

### Node Status[​](#node-status "Direct link to Node Status")

* `true`: Node is healthy and operational
* `false`: Node is unhealthy or unreachable

### Health Aggregation[​](#health-aggregation "Direct link to Health Aggregation")

* Cluster health is determined by the health of its nodes
* Project health is determined by the health of its clusters
* Global health is determined by the health of all clusters
* A single unhealthy component will set the parent's health to `false`

## Alert System[​](#alert-system "Direct link to Alert System")

Kublade implements a comprehensive alert system:

### Alert Levels[​](#alert-levels "Direct link to Alert Levels")

* `info`: Informational alerts
* `warning`: Potential issues
* `critical`: Immediate attention needed

### Alert Types[​](#alert-types "Direct link to Alert Types")

* `cluster`: Cluster-related alerts
* `node`: Node-specific alerts
* `resource`: Resource usage alerts
* `network`: Network-related alerts
* `storage`: Storage capacity alerts

### Alert Triggers[​](#alert-triggers "Direct link to Alert Triggers")

* Resource thresholds exceeded
* Cluster status changes
* Node status changes
* Network issues detected
* Storage capacity warnings

## Metrics and Dashboards[​](#metrics-and-dashboards "Direct link to Metrics and Dashboards")

### Available Metrics[​](#available-metrics "Direct link to Available Metrics")

* CPU utilization per node/cluster
* Memory usage and allocation
* Storage capacity and usage
* Network throughput and latency
* Pod count and distribution
* Resource quota utilization
* Node health status
* Cluster performance metrics

### Dashboard Views[​](#dashboard-views "Direct link to Dashboard Views")

* Global system overview
* Project-level dashboards
* Cluster-specific views
* Node detail pages
* Resource utilization graphs
* Historical trend analysis
* Alert status overview
* Performance metrics
