# Projects

Projects are organizational units that group clusters and deployments together. They serve as a way to organize resources and manage permissions at a higher level.

## Project Structure

A project consists of:
- Clusters: Kubernetes clusters where deployments run
- Deployments: Application deployments managed by the project
- Network Policies: Rules defining how deployments can communicate
- Members: Users with specific permissions for the project

## Project Organization

### Resource Hierarchy
```
Project
├── Clusters
│   ├── Cluster 1
│   └── Cluster 2
├── Deployments
│   ├── Deployment 1
│   ├── Deployment 2
│   └── Network Policies
└── Members
    ├── User 1 (Project Manager)
    ├── User 2 (Deployment Manager)
    └── User 3 (Viewer)
```

### Resource Management
- Templates are managed globally and can be used across projects
- Clusters are assigned to specific projects
- Deployments are always associated with a project
- Network policies are scoped to project deployments

## Project Permissions

Projects use a granular permission system to control access to resources:

### Permission Structure
```
projects.[project_id].[action]
```

Where:
- `project_id`: The specific project UUID
- `action`: The allowed action (view, create, update, delete)

### Common Permission Patterns
```
projects.*                    # All actions on all projects
projects.[id].*              # All actions on specific project
projects.[id].view           # View specific project
projects.[id].deployments.*  # Manage deployments in project
```

### Role Examples

1. **Project Manager**
   ```php
   [
       'projects.[id].*',              // Full project access
       'projects.[id].deployments.*',  // Manage all deployments
       'projects.[id].clusters.*',     // Manage all clusters
       'projects.[id].network-policies.*' // Manage network policies
   ]
   ```

2. **Deployment Manager**
   ```php
   [
       'projects.[id].view',           // View project details
       'projects.[id].deployments.*',  // Manage deployments
       'projects.[id].network-policies.*' // Manage network policies
   ]
   ```

3. **Project Viewer**
   ```php
   [
       'projects.[id].view',           // View project details
       'projects.[id].deployments.view', // View deployments
       'projects.[id].clusters.view'    // View clusters
   ]
   ```

## Project Management

### Creating Projects
1. Navigate to the projects page
2. Click "Create Project"
3. Provide:
   - Project name
   - Description

### Managing Clusters
1. Add clusters to the project
2. Configure cluster access
3. Set up cluster-specific settings
4. Manage cluster resources

### Managing Deployments
1. Create deployments within the project
2. Assign deployments to clusters
3. Configure deployment settings
4. Manage deployment lifecycle

### Network Policies
1. Define allowed communication paths
2. Set up ingress/egress rules
3. Configure network isolation
4. Manage policy updates

## Best Practices

1. **Project Organization**
   - Use meaningful project names
   - Group related deployments
   - Document project purpose
   - Maintain clear resource boundaries

2. **Permission Management**
   - Follow principle of least privilege
   - Regularly review permissions
   - Document role responsibilities
   - Use specific permissions over wildcards

3. **Resource Management**
   - Monitor resource usage
   - Plan cluster capacity
   - Document deployment patterns
   - Maintain network policy documentation

4. **Security**
   - Regular security audits
   - Access review cycles
   - Network policy reviews
   - Compliance documentation

## Project Lifecycle

### Creation
1. Define project scope
2. Set up initial permissions
3. Configure clusters
4. Document project structure

### Maintenance
1. Regular permission reviews
2. Resource usage monitoring
3. Network policy updates
4. Documentation updates

### Cleanup
1. Archive unused deployments
2. Remove unused clusters
3. Update permissions
4. Document changes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Permission Problems**
   - Verify user role assignments
   - Check project-specific permissions
   - Review permission inheritance
   - Validate resource access

2. **Resource Access**
   - Confirm cluster connectivity
   - Verify deployment permissions
   - Check network policy rules
   - Validate resource quotas

3. **Network Issues**
   - Review network policies
   - Check cluster connectivity
   - Verify service mesh configuration
   - Validate DNS settings
